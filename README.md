Diabetes Prediction using Diagnostic Measurements

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset consists of female patients, at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage, and it originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Steps in the Project:
Read the Data: Load and explore the dataset.
Data Visualization: Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships between features.
Prepare the Dataset: Clean and preprocess the data for training and testing.
Prediction: Use machine learning models to make predictions.
Confusion Matrix: Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix.
ROC Curve: Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model.
AUC: Calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for model evaluation.
Random Forest: Implement the Random Forest classifier to predict diabetes.
